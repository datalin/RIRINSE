# Why do this? 

The basic reasons the INR distributions data needs improving
The kinds of problems it is looking at:

 * How to identify where resources are delegated
   * Where are the resources bought from?
   * Which country is acquiring these resources ?
   * In which country are the resouces being sold to / or used ? E.g: BD buys and IP block & is listed under Ireland but being used in Thailand.   
 * How to identify where resources are being used - The "Geolocation" problem
 * How to correlate the resources between different information sources
   * centralized display of resource distribution amoungst all RIRs (with different time zones)
   * Geofeed, Maxmind, caida, Internet Health Report.
* What time in APNIC GMT can represent all collected data from yesterday?
