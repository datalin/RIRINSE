# Why do this? 

The basic reasons the INR distributions data needs improving
The kinds of problems it is looking at:

 * How to identify where resources are delegated
   * Where are the resources bought from?
   * Which country is acquiring these resources ?
   * In which country are the resouces being sold to / or used ? E.g: BD buys and IP block & is listed under Ireland but being used in Thailand.   
 * How to identify where resources are being used - The "Geolocation" problem
 * How to correlate the resources between different information sources
   * centralized display of resource distribution amoungst all RIRs (with different time zones)
   * Geofeed, Maxmind, caida, Internet Health Report.
* What time in APNIC GMT can represent all collected data from yesterday?  
* Create a business inteligence application that can we effectively track and understand the movement of resources across different stages, including where they are sourced, acquired, used, and ultimately distributed, considering the need to gather information from various sources and present it in a centralized and comprehensive manner.
