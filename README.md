# RIRINSE-APNIC57

RIRINSE-APNIC57 is a team project at the APNIC57 Hackathon to explore the RIR internet number resources (INR) data and how to relate it to other sources of information.

## [Basic Building Blocks](Building%20Blocks/README.md)

A collection of basic tools to manipulate the data.

## [The delegated files](delegated-files/README.md).

The RIR all produce a daily statistics file called the 'delegated' statistics file or 'stats file'


## [Why](Why/README.md)

An exploration of the motivations to solve this suite of problems.

- One of the problems is we get to see the delegation but not the disposition of an IP Address.

# Cross-RIR Resource Disposition [Analysis](Example-Code/README.md)

This repository contains a Python script for analyzing Cross-RIR resource disposition data by @shankarganesh.pj. The script fetches data from various sources such as the NRO statistics page, RouteViews, and REX (Resource Certification), parses the data, and performs basic analysis.
