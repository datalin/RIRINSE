## RIRINSE - (RIR Internet Number ?)

# Why
### There are two many semi documented resources and there isnt a full catalog for all the data services provided by RIRs, that makes it hard to work with for people and for programs. For example: if you want to know where you can get the current resource disposition is under a certain economy, and where those resources are geographically located, its very hard to do. 

# What
- Make a catalog of all the services under APNIC as an RIR.
- Find all the Documentation for the servides, and API endpoints and link it with service name with easy to understand descripion for Humans.
- Also find or build all the YAML files for all the API endpoints and link to the services in the catalog.

# How
- Find all the service name and initate the [building blocks] (https://github.com/datalin/RIRINSE-APNIC57/blob/main/Building%20Blocks/README.md)
- 

# Challanges

# Outcomes

# Future Work

More of the same
- Find more services under APNIC as an RIR
- Do this same documentation for all the other RIRs
