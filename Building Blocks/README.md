# Building Blocks

| **Data Source** | **Description** | **Relevance to Resource Tracking** | **Source Link** |
|---|---|---|---|
| whois | Provides information about IP address blocks and their ownership. | Identifies the current holder of a resource and contact details. | [https://wq.apnic.net/](https://wq.apnic.net/) |
| rdap | Offers an alternative way to query for resource registration data, often with a more user-friendly interface than whois. | Similar to whois, helps identify the current holder of a resource. | [https://www.apnic.net/about-apnic/whois_search/about/rdap/](https://www.apnic.net/about-apnic/whois_search/about/rdap/) |
| dash | Enables searching for specific resources based on various criteria, such as IP address, ASN, or location. | Aids in finding specific resources and their associated information. **Dash requires APNIC Account to login.** | [https://dash.apnic.net/](https://dash.apnic.net/) |
| rex | Provides access to historical resource registration data. | Useful for tracking ownership changes and identifying past holders of a resource. | [https://rex.apnic.net/](https://rex.apnic.net/) |
| delegated statistics file | Contains aggregated statistics on resource delegations, including allocation sizes and regional distribution. | Provides insights into overall resource allocation patterns and trends. | [https://ftp.apnic.net/stats/apnic/delegated-apnic-latest](https://ftp.apnic.net/stats/apnic/delegated-apnic-latest) <br> [https://www.nro.net/about/rirs/statistics/](https://www.nro.net/about/rirs/statistics/) | 
| transfer log | Tracks transfers of IP resources between different holders. | Helps to understand how resources are moving between different entities. | [https://www.apnic.net/manage-ip/manage-resources/transfer-resources/transfer-logs/](https://www.apnic.net/manage-ip/manage-resources/transfer-resources/transfer-logs/) |
| reverse DNS | Maps IP addresses to domain names, aiding in resource location. | Can provide clues about the organization or service associated with an IP address. | [https://www.apnic.net/manage-ip/manage-resources/reverse-dns/access-to-reverse-dns/](https://www.apnic.net/manage-ip/manage-resources/reverse-dns/access-to-reverse-dns/) |
| bgp data | Shows how IP prefixes are advertised and routed on the internet. | Helps to visualize the path that resources take across the network. [This task requires more work so it will be skipped for now]: This is a footnote content. | [https://thyme.apnic.net/](https://thyme.apnic.net/) |
| RPKI | Provides cryptographic validation of routing information, enhancing security. | While not directly related to resource tracking, RPKI helps to ensure the integrity of routing data, which is crucial for understanding how resources are flowing.
